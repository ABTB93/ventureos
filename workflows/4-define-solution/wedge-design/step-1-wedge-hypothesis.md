# Step 1: Wedge Hypothesis Generation
<!-- Phase 4, Step 1 — Week 4 -->
<!-- Agent: Product Strategist -->

## Objective
Generate 3-5 wedge entry point options, evaluate them, and select the most promising wedge to develop. Define the wedge clearly: smallest sellable product, target customer, and scaling hypothesis.

---

## 1.1 Run Wedge Storming Exercise

Using the "wedge-storm" brainstorming technique from `brainstorming-techniques.csv`:

1. Load `pain-atomization.md` (primary pain) and `pain-journey-map.md` (solution entry points)
2. Generate 5-10 wedge ideas — each answering: "What is the smallest part of the solution we could build and sell first?"
3. For each wedge idea:
   - Name / short description
   - What specific pain does it solve?
   - Who specifically uses it?
   - How is it delivered / what does it consist of?
   - What is the MINIMUM to make it useful?
   - What does success look like for the customer in month 1?

---

## 1.2 Evaluate Wedge Options

Score each wedge option on:

| Criterion | Why it matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| Pain specificity | Does it solve the highest FIP pain? |
| Time to build | Can we prototype in 2-4 weeks? |
| Differentiation | Is it clearly different from what exists? |
| Customer desirability | Would the ICP actually use this? |
| Mothership leverage | Can we use mothership assets to accelerate? |
| Scalability | Does this wedge grow toward the big vision? |

Score 1-5 per criterion. Select the highest-scoring option.

## 1.3 Define the Selected Wedge

Using the `wedge-definition.md` template, define the winning wedge:
- What it is (1-2 sentences)
- Who it's for (specific ICP segment — as narrow as possible)
- What specific atomic pain it addresses
- What the core mechanism is (how it works)
- What primary value it creates (specific: saves X hours, reduces Y cost)
- How it's differentiated from alternatives
- The wedge-to-vision scaling hypothesis

---

## 1.4 Checkpoint

**GUIDED MODE:** Present wedge options and selected wedge to user. Ask: "Does this feel like the right starting point? Is the wedge small enough and differentiated enough?"

**YOLO MODE:** Proceed to Step 2.

## Step 1 Outputs
- `wedge-definition.md` (initial version — to be refined in Step 4)
- Updated `venture-state.yaml`: hypotheses.wedge, hypotheses.solution
