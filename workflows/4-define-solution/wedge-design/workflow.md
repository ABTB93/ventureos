# Wedge Design Workflow
<!-- Phase 4: Define the Solution — Weeks 4-7 -->
<!-- Agent: Product Strategist -->
<!-- Step-file architecture: 4 sequential steps -->

## Overview

Design the solution wedge — the smallest part of the bigger vision that can be quickly brought to market, validated with customers, and scaled toward the full vision. This workflow covers: wedge hypothesis generation, value proposition development, prototype creation, and solution testing.

**Pre-requisites from Phase 3:**
- `pain-atomization.md` — primary pain with FIP ≥ 3.0
- `icp-profile.md` — defined Ideal Customer Profile
- `pain-journey-map.md` — solution entry points identified

**Execution mode:**
- **Guided:** Pause at every template-output checkpoint
- **Yolo:** Run all 4 steps autonomously

## Pre-flight Check

Load from venture-state.yaml:
1. Primary pain hypothesis (hypotheses.problem)
2. ICP hypothesis (hypotheses.customer)
3. Load `pain-atomization.md`, `icp-profile.md`, `pain-journey-map.md`
4. Load `{project-root}/ventureOS/data/techniques/brainstorming-techniques.csv` for wedge-storm and value-prop-sprint techniques
5. Load `{project-root}/ventureOS/data/techniques/synthetic-tools.csv` for vibe-code-wedge and synthetic testing tools

## Step 3: Prototype
**File:** `step-3-prototype.md`

## Step 4: Solution Testing and Refinement
**File:** `step-4-solution-testing.md`

## Phase 4 Completion Criteria

All guiding questions answered with evidence:
- [ ] Can the team describe the wedge? (wedge-definition.md)
- [ ] Can the team articulate the big vision? (vision-story.md)
- [ ] Is the solution technically feasible? (solution-feasibility.md)
- [ ] What makes the solution special? (value-proposition.md)
- [ ] Wedge-to-vision scaling hypothesis? (wedge-definition.md)
- [ ] Can the target customer use the product? (solution testing results)
