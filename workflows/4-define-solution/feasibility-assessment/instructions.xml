  <overview>
    Assess whether the wedge solution can be built. Evaluate all four routes: Build (internal development), Buy (acquire technology), Partner (use a third party), Invest (stake in an existing company). Map the technology ecosystem. Recommend the optimal implementation approach.
  </overview>

  <step n="1" name="solution-requirements">
    <title>Define Technical Requirements</title>
    <agent>product-strategist</agent>
    <instructions>
      Load wedge-definition.md and value-proposition.md.
      Define the technical requirements for the wedge:
      1. Core capabilities required (what must the system do?)
      2. Data requirements (what data is needed? where does it come from?)
      3. Integration requirements (what systems must it connect to?)
      4. AI/ML requirements (if applicable)
      5. Security and compliance requirements
      6. Scalability requirements
      Document in solution-feasibility.md Step 1 section.
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step n="2" name="build-buy-partner">
    <title>Build / Buy / Partner / Invest Analysis</title>
    <agent>product-strategist</agent>
    <instructions>
      For each route, assess feasibility using the solution-feasibility.md template:

      BUILD: Can we build the core capability in-house? What tech stack? What team? Timeline?
      BUY: Are there existing products or APIs that provide this capability? (Web search for options)
      PARTNER: Are there companies with this capability we could white-label, resell, or integrate with?
      INVEST: Are there early-stage companies with this capability worth investing in?

      Use web search to find candidate technologies, APIs, and partners for BUY/PARTNER routes.
      Score each option 1-5 on feasibility.
      Recommend a route (or hybrid approach).

    <template-output file="{output_folder}/{venture_name}/solution-feasibility.md">
      Save feasibility analysis with all four routes evaluated.

  </step>

  <step n="3" name="ecosystem-map">
    <title>Ecosystem Mapping</title>
    <agent>product-strategist</agent>
    <instructions>
      Map the technology ecosystem the solution operates within using the ecosystem-map.md template:
      1. Key suppliers and enablers (what does our solution depend on?)
      2. Competitors and substitutes (using web research — already done in Phase 2 but refresh for solution context)
      3. Complementors (who enhances our solution or vice versa)
      4. Platform dependencies (APIs, data platforms, cloud providers)
      5. Integration landscape (what systems our ICP already uses that we must integrate with)
      6. Partnership candidates — who would make a valuable partnership?

      Use web search to identify technology players, platforms, and ecosystem participants.
    </instructions>
    <template-output file="{output_folder}/{venture_name}/ecosystem-map.md">
      Save ecosystem map with partnership candidates.
    </template-output>
  </step>

  <step n="4" name="feasibility-verdict">
    <title>Feasibility Verdict and Build Plan</title>
    <agent>product-strategist</agent>
    <instructions>
      Produce the feasibility verdict:
      1. Overall feasibility: Feasible / Feasible with caveats / Not feasible
      2. Recommended implementation approach (build/buy/partner/invest or hybrid)
      3. Biggest technical risk and mitigation
      4. Prototype-to-wedge build plan (phases and timelines)
      5. Mothership technology assets that can accelerate development

      Update venture-state.yaml: completed_artifacts, guiding_questions.solution (technical feasibility question)
    </instructions>
    <state-update file="{project-root}/ventureOS/_memory/venture-sidecar/venture-state.yaml">
      Update: completed_artifacts (solution-feasibility, ecosystem-map), guiding_questions.solution
