  <overview>
    Deep market and competitive analysis for the venture's target domain (Weeks 2-3). Uses web search for real data. Builds on any domain research from Phase 0 if available. Answers the guiding questions: Is the market large and growing? What are the barriers to entry? Who are the key players and where are they weak?
  </overview>

  <step n="1" name="load-prior-research">
    <title>Load Prior Research Context</title>
    <agent>domain-explorer</agent>
    <instructions>
      Check venture-state.yaml for any completed domain research artifacts.
      If Phase 0 domain-deep-dive was completed: load those findings as context to avoid duplication.
      If starting fresh: note the domain from venture-state.yaml hypotheses.
      Confirm with user: domain, geography focus, segment scope, research_depth setting.
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step n="2" name="competitive-landscape">
    <title>Competitive Landscape Analysis</title>
    <agent>domain-explorer</agent>
    <instructions>
      Using web search, conduct deep competitive analysis:
      1. Map 8-15 players: direct competitors, indirect competitors, substitutes
      2. For each player: funding stage, revenue scale, target customer, core product, key differentiators, recent moves
      3. Identify competitive clusters (groups of companies fighting for the same customer)
      4. Map each competitor's weaknesses based on: product reviews, job postings, news, community complaints
      5. Identify white space: who is NOT being served well?
      6. Flag: which competitors could pivot into our space if we find strong demand?
      Cite all sources. Apply research_depth setting.

      GUIDED MODE: Review competitive landscape with user. Any missing players?
      YOLO MODE: Continue to Step 3.

  <step n="3" name="market-sizing">
    <title>Market Sizing — Top-Down and Bottom-Up</title>
    <agent>domain-explorer</agent>
    <instructions>
      Using web search, build comprehensive market sizing using the market-sizing.md template:
      TOP-DOWN:
      1. Find 2-3 credible industry reports for TAM (cite sources and dates)
      2. Apply geographic and segment filters for SAM
      3. Estimate realistic SOM for Years 1-3
      4. Note CAGR from credible sources

      BOTTOM-UP:
      1. Estimate # of addressable target companies (use LinkedIn, industry directories, census data)
      2. Apply ICP filters (size, vertical, geography)
      3. Multiply by realistic ACV hypothesis
      4. Triangulate top-down and bottom-up estimates

      Flag if TAM &lt; $100M — significant risk signal.
    </instructions>
    <template-output file="{output_folder}/{venture_name}/market-sizing.md">
      Save market sizing with both methodologies and all sources.

  <step n="4" name="barriers-trends">
    <title>Barrier-to-Entry and Trend Analysis</title>
    <agent>domain-explorer</agent>
    <instructions>
      Assess market entry dynamics:
      1. Map key barriers to entry: regulatory, capital, technology, network effects, switching costs, distribution
      2. For each barrier: severity (low/medium/high) and our mitigation strategy
      3. Identify enabling trends making NOW the right time:
         - Technology shifts (AI, cloud, mobile)
         - Regulatory changes
         - Behavioral shifts (post-COVID, generational)
         - Economic shifts
      4. Assess: does the mothership have assets that lower key barriers?

  <step n="5" name="synthesis-and-update">
    <title>Synthesize and Update Venture State</title>
    <agent>domain-explorer</agent>
    <instructions>
      Produce a one-page market intelligence summary:
      1. Market: size, growth, maturity
      2. Competitive dynamics: who leads, where the white space is
      3. Key barriers and how to overcome them
      4. Top 3 market insights that should inform our pain hypothesis
      5. Is this market large enough to support a venture? (≥$100M TAM?)
      Update venture-state.yaml with completed artifacts and guiding_questions.domain answers.
