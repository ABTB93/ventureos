  <overview>
    Map the ecosystem stakeholders and create initial persona hypotheses. Answers: Who matters most? Who has the primary pain? Who is the buyer vs. the user? Who are the advocates and blockers? Produces the Stakeholder Map and initial Pain Hypothesis.
  </overview>

  <step n="1" name="stakeholder-brainstorm">
    <title>Stakeholder Brainstorm</title>
    <agent>domain-explorer</agent>
    <instructions>
      Map all stakeholder categories in the venture's ecosystem:
      1. Who creates the problem / pain?
      2. Who experiences the pain most directly? (primary sufferer)
      3. Who pays for solutions to the pain? (buyer — may differ from user)
      4. Who influences the buying decision?
      5. Who would block or resist a new solution?
      6. Who would champion a new solution?
      7. Who regulates this space?
      Use the stakeholder-map.md template to organize all stakeholders.
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step n="2" name="buyer-user-analysis">
    <title>Buyer vs. User Analysis</title>
    <agent>domain-explorer</agent>
    <instructions>
      Determine if buyer and user are the same person:
      1. Who uses the solution day-to-day?
      2. Who signs the check / approves the budget?
      3. If they are different: what does each need to be convinced?
      4. Which pain is more acute — the user's operational pain or the buyer's strategic/cost pain?
      5. Which stakeholder should the venture prioritize first to get a sale?
      Note: In B2B, buyer ≠ user is common. This affects the sales motion fundamentally.
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step n="3" name="ai-persona-hypotheses">
    <title>AI Stakeholder Persona Hypotheses</title>
    <agent>domain-explorer</agent>
    <instructions>
      Create 2-3 initial persona hypotheses using AI synthesis (NOT real data — clearly labeled):
      For each persona:
      - Name / archetype
      - Role and company context
      - Day in the life (how they operate)
      - Primary pain related to the venture domain
      - How they solve it today (workaround)
      - What success looks like for them
      - What would make them change behavior

      Label each persona: "⚠️ HYPOTHESIS — AI-synthesized, not based on real interviews. To be validated."
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step n="4" name="pain-hypothesis">
    <title>Initial Pain Hypothesis</title>
    <agent>domain-explorer</agent>
    <instructions>
      Based on the stakeholder analysis, formulate the initial pain hypothesis:
      1. Primary pain hypothesis: who, what pain, when it triggers, what consequence
      2. 2-3 secondary pain hypotheses (alternatives to explore)
      3. Preliminary FIP estimate for each (Frequency / Intensity / Prevalence)
      4. Key assumptions to test in Phase 3 interviews
      5. Interview target: who to interview first, how many, what types
      Use the pain-hypothesis.md template.
    </instructions>
    <template-output file="{output_folder}/{venture_name}/pain-hypothesis.md">
      Save initial pain hypothesis with assumptions to test.
    </template-output>
  </step>

  <step n="5" name="stakeholder-map-output">
    <title>Produce Stakeholder Map</title>
    <agent>domain-explorer</agent>
    <instructions>
      Compile all stakeholder work into the Stakeholder Map using the stakeholder-map.md template.
      Fill all sections including the Power/Interest grid.
      Note which mothership relationships can be leveraged for access.
      Update venture-state.yaml with completed artifacts and guiding_questions.domain answers.
    </instructions>
    <template-output file="{output_folder}/{venture_name}/stakeholder-map.md">
      Save completed Stakeholder Map.
    </template-output>
    <state-update file="{project-root}/ventureOS/_memory/venture-sidecar/venture-state.yaml">
      Update: completed_artifacts, hypotheses.customer, guiding_questions.domain
    </state-update>
