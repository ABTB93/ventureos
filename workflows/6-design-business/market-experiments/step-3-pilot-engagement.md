# Step 3: Pilot Customer Engagement
<!-- Phase 6, Market Experiments Step 3 -->
<!-- Agent: Growth Strategist -->

## Objective
Execute B2B pilot customer outreach. Get live demos scheduled. Convert demos to pilot customers. Build the pipeline that proves go-to-market viability for the final pitch.

---

## 3.1 Execute Outreach

Using the pilot pipeline from `experiment-plan.md` and messaging from `messaging-infrastructure.md`:

**LinkedIn Outreach:**
1. Draft connection request (< 300 chars) using LinkedIn message template from messaging-infrastructure.md
2. Draft follow-up sequence (3-touch: connection → value add → ask for meeting)
3. Target: 20-30 outreaches per week

**Cold Email:**
1. Use cold email templates from messaging-infrastructure.md
2. Send from: founder or team member (higher open rates than generic address)
3. Personalize: reference something specific about their company or role
4. Follow-up: 3 emails over 10 days if no response

**Warm Introductions:**
1. Leverage mothership customer relationships (from mothership-asset-map.md)
2. Ask existing contacts for introductions to target accounts
3. Use Sponsor relationships

Track all outreach in the pilot pipeline table (from experiment-plan.md):
- Status progression: Prospect → Outreach sent → Replied → Demo scheduled → Demo completed → Pilot agreed

## 3.2 Run Live Demos

For B2B demos, use this structure (adapted from sales-process-map.md):

**Demo agenda (45-60 min):**
1. Open (5 min): Confirm pain they described / discovered in outreach
2. Show (20 min): Walkthrough prototype or wedge product focused on their specific pain
3. Connect (10 min): How does this solve their exact situation?
4. Probe (10 min): What resonates? What's missing? Would they use this?
5. Close (5 min): Next step — pilot engagement offer

**Pilot offer:**
- What the pilot customer gets: [access to X for Y weeks / free / reduced price]
- What we get: [usage data, feedback sessions, case study rights]
- Commitment: [meeting cadence, feedback survey, intro to colleagues]

## 3.3 Capture Demo Results

After each demo, record:
- Company, contact, role
- Pain confirmed: Yes/No
- Product resonance: 1-5
- Would pilot: Yes / No / Maybe
- Key feedback / objections heard
- Next action and owner
- Estimated deal size / ACV if converted

## 3.4 Pricing Experiment

During demos, test pricing:
1. Present the pricing tier structure from pricing-model.md
2. Probe: "Does this pricing feel right given the value you'd get?"
3. Test: "Would you commit to a 3-month paid pilot at $[price]?"
4. Record reactions: reactions to price, objections, counter-offers

Update pricing-model.md with real willingness-to-pay signals.

---

## 3.5 Checkpoint

**GUIDED MODE:** After first 5 demos: review results with user. Ask: "Are we getting the right reaction from demos? Should we adjust the demo flow, pricing, or pilot offer?"

**YOLO MODE:** Record all demo results and proceed to Step 4.
