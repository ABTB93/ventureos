# Market Experiments Workflow
<!-- Phase 6: Design the Business — Weeks 10-11 -->
<!-- Agent: Growth Strategist + Financial Analyst -->
<!-- Step-file architecture: 4 steps -->

## Overview

Run real market experiments to validate GTM assumptions, generate traction data for the final pitch, and build a pilot customer pipeline. This is where vibe coding (landing pages, ads) and real customer outreach happens.

**Key outputs:**
- Landing page live with conversion data
- Paid ad variants tested
- Pilot customer pipeline (B2B demos)
- CAC analysis by channel
- Desirability and conversion data for the final pitch
