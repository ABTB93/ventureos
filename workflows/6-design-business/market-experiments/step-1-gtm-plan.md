# Step 1: GTM Plan and Messaging Infrastructure
<!-- Phase 6, Market Experiments Step 1 -->
<!-- Agent: Growth Strategist + Business Architect -->

## Objective
Build the messaging foundation and GTM strategy before launching any experiments. Good experiments need clear hypotheses and consistent messaging.

---

## 1.1 Refresh Competitive Research

Using web search, refresh competitor analysis for GTM:
1. Update competitive-analysis.md if >4 weeks old
2. Check for: new competitor launches, pricing changes, funding announcements
3. Identify: what messaging are competitors using? (LinkedIn ads, G2 reviews, pricing pages)
4. Find the gap in messaging — what is no one saying that our ICP cares about?

---

## 1.2 Build Messaging Infrastructure

Using the `messaging-infrastructure.md` template, build the full messaging stack:

1. **Positioning statement** (Geoffrey Moore format)
2. **Tagline options** (3 variants for testing)
3. **Messaging hierarchy:** Headline → Subheadline → Problem → Solution → Proof → CTA
4. **Messaging by persona:** Primary ICP vs. Economic Buyer — different messages
5. **Objection-handling map** (5 key objections + responses)
6. **Channel-specific messaging:** LinkedIn outreach, cold email, landing page, paid ads

## 1.3 GTM Strategy

Using the `market-experiment.md` template (GTM section):

1. **Primary acquisition channel** (best fit for ICP: outbound / inbound / paid / partnerships)
2. **Channel sequencing** (in what order will we test channels?)
3. **Sales motion** (PLG / SLG / channel-led / hybrid)
4. **CAC hypothesis by channel** (what do we expect to pay per acquired customer?)
5. **90-day GTM playbook** (weeks 10-12: what happens in each week?)

Save GTM plan to: `{output_folder}/{venture_name}/market-experiment.md` (GTM section)

## 1.4 B2B Sales Process Map

Using the `sales-process-map.md` template:
1. Map the B2B sales process from lead to close
2. Define qualification criteria (BANT)
3. Map all decision makers in the buying process
4. Identify typical objections and responses
5. Set sales KPI targets for Weeks 10-12

Save: `{output_folder}/{venture_name}/sales-process-map.md`

## 1.5 Checkpoint

**GUIDED MODE:** Review messaging and GTM plan with user. Ask: "Does this messaging feel right? Is the GTM plan achievable in 2-3 weeks?"

**YOLO MODE:** Proceed to Step 2.
