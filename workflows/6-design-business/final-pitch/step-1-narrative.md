# Step 1: Vision Story and Financial Narrative
<!-- Phase 6, Final Pitch Step 1 -->
<!-- Agent: Pitch Master + Financial Analyst -->

## Objective
Build the foundational narrative layer for the final pitch: the From/To vision story and the financial narrative. These inform every slide in the deck.

---

## 1.1 Finalize the Vision Story

Load or create the vision story using `vision-story.md` template:

**ACT 1 — The World Before (FROM):**
- The undeniable market shift happening now
- What the customer's world looks like today (vivid, specific, data-backed)
- The systemic pain and its cost (time, money, opportunity)
- Numbers that make it real (from interviews and market data)

**ACT 2 — The Shift:**
- The enabling insight or technology that makes a new solution possible NOW
- Why previous solutions have failed
- The wedge — where the change starts

**ACT 3 — The World After (TO):**
- What the customer's world looks like with our solution
- The transformation (specific, before/after contrast)
- The scaling path from wedge to big vision
- The market we're building toward

**Refine the story:**
- Is the hook strong enough? Would an investor lean in or tune out?
- Is every claim backed by evidence from the venture's research?
- Is the vision big enough but grounded in the wedge?

## 1.2 Build the Financial Model

Load `financial-model.md` if partially complete. Otherwise create from scratch using the template.

Using all available data:
1. Key assumptions (ACV from pricing-model.md, CAC from conversion-analysis.md, Gross Margin from business-model-canvas.md)
2. Revenue projections: Year 1 / Year 2 / Year 3 (conservative and base case)
3. Cost structure (headcount, infrastructure, sales & marketing)
4. Unit economics: LTV, CAC, LTV:CAC, Payback Period
5. Cash flow: burn rate, break-even month, funding requirements
6. Use of proceeds: how the raise will be allocated

## 1.3 Narrative Key Messages

Extract the 5 key messages that will thread through the entire pitch:
1. The market opportunity: [hook-worthy statement]
2. The pain: [validated, evidence-backed]
3. The differentiation: [why we win]
4. The traction: [most compelling data point]
5. The ask: [clear and confident]

These become the anchors for each slide in Step 2.

## Checkpoint

**GUIDED MODE:** Review vision story and financial narrative with user. Ask: "Does this feel like the right story arc? Is the financial model grounded in real assumptions?"

**YOLO MODE:** Proceed to Step 2.
