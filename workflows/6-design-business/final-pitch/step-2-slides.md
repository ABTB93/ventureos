## 2.3 Pitch Deck Quality Check

Before declaring the deck complete:
- [ ] Every claim is backed by evidence (no invented data)
- [ ] Traction slide leads with the strongest number
- [ ] Vision story thread runs from Slide 1 to Slide 11
- [ ] Every slide has a clear point (one key message per slide)
- [ ] The ask in Slide 11 is specific, confident, and justified by the data

**GUIDED MODE:** Review each slide with user. Ask: "Does this slide earn its place? Is every claim defensible?"

**YOLO MODE:** Complete deck and proceed to Step 3.
