  <overview>
    Build the initial business case for the venture before the check-in gate. Identify and remove venture killer risks. Create the operating and experiment plan for Phase 6. Establish the pilot customer pipeline.

  <step n="1" name="reverse-pitch">
    <title>Reverse Pitch — Surface Hidden Risks</title>
    <agent>venture-ops</agent>
    <instructions>
      Run the "reverse-pitch" brainstorming technique from brainstorming-techniques.csv:
      1. Each team member (or persona if solo) argues WHY this venture should be KILLED
      2. Collect all kill arguments — the more uncomfortable, the better
      3. Group kill arguments into categories (market, competitive, technical, business model, regulatory, team/mothership)
      4. Assess each: is this a real risk or a manageable one?
      5. Identify the top 5 venture killer risks that require active mitigation

      Record all kill arguments in venture-killer-risks.md (Reverse Pitch section).
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step n="2" name="risk-registry">
    <title>Venture Killer Risk Registry</title>
    <agent>venture-ops</agent>
    <instructions>
      Using the venture-killer-risks.md template, build a comprehensive risk registry:
      1. Market and customer risks
      2. Competitive risks
      3. Technical and product risks
      4. Business model risks
      5. Regulatory and legal risks
      6. Mothership and organizational risks

      For each risk: likelihood (1-5), impact (1-5), risk score, priority, owner, mitigation action.
      Identify the Top 5 Venture Killer Risks and assign mitigation owners and deadlines.

  <step n="3" name="experiment-plan">
    <title>Operating and Experiment Plan</title>
    <agent>venture-ops</agent>
    <instructions>
      Create the experiment and operating plan for the next phase (Weeks 10-12) using experiment-plan.md:
      1. Phase objectives: what must we prove in Phase 6?
      2. Experiments to run: landing page test, paid acquisition, outbound/B2B demos, pilot engagement
      3. For each experiment: hypothesis, metric, success threshold, owner, timeline, budget
      4. KPIs for the plan period
      5. Pilot customer pipeline targets
      6. Budget and resource requirements
      7. Decisions needed from NVB / Sponsor

      This plan feeds directly into the check-in pitch.

  <step n="4" name="pilot-pipeline">
    <title>Pilot Customer Pipeline</title>
    <agent>growth-strategist</agent>
    <instructions>
      Build the initial pilot customer pipeline:
      1. Define target account criteria (based on ICP)
      2. Identify 15-20 target accounts by name
      3. For each: company name, contact name/role, source, status, next action
      4. Outreach strategy: what message, what channel, what offer?
      5. Pilot structure: what do pilot customers get? What do we get? Timeline?
      6. Success metric for the pilot: what defines a successful pilot?

      Save pilot pipeline to experiment-plan.md (Pilot section).
      Update venture-state.yaml with guiding_questions.business_case answers.
