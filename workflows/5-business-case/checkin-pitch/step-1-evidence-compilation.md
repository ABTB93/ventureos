# Step 1: Evidence Compilation for Check-in Pitch
<!-- Phase 5, Check-in Pitch Step 1 -->
<!-- Agent: Pitch Master + Venture Master -->

## Objective
Compile all validated evidence from Phases 1-4 into a structured evidence brief. This becomes the backbone of the check-in pitch deck.

## 1.1 Load All Completed Artifacts

Load and review the following from venture-state.yaml (completed_artifacts):
- `team-charter.md` — team setup
- `mothership-asset-map.md` — mothership assets
- `market-sizing.md` — market opportunity
- `competitive-analysis.md` — competitive context
- `interview-synthesis.md` — customer research
- `pain-atomization.md` — pain validation and FIP scores
- `icp-profile.md` — ICP definition
- `wedge-definition.md` — solution hypothesis
- `value-proposition.md` — value prop testing results
- `experiment-plan.md` — Phase 6 plan

## 1.2 Compile Evidence by Check-in Gate Criteria

Structure evidence against the three check-in gate focus criteria (from gate-rubric.yaml):

### Customer Pain Validation Evidence
- Number of interviews conducted:
- Interview types (pain-point / expert / concept card / synthetic):
- Primary pain validated: [statement] | FIP Score: ___
- Top 3 evidence quotes:
- ICP defined: Yes/No
- Buyer vs. user mapped: Yes/No
- Score estimate (1-5):

### Market Opportunity Evidence
- TAM: $___B (source)
- SAM: $___M (methodology)
- Market growth rate: ___% CAGR
- Key barrier to entry identified:
- Score estimate (1-5):

### Wedge Clarity and Differentiation Evidence
- Wedge defined: [one sentence]
- Value prop tested: Yes/No | Average resonance score: ___/5
- Top differentiation from alternatives:
- Scaling hypothesis articulated: Yes/No
- Score estimate (1-5):

## 1.3 Identify Gaps and Honest Limitations

Be honest about what is NOT yet validated:
- What do we still not know?
- What assumptions remain untested?
- What are the top 2-3 risks going into Phase 6?

These go into the check-in pitch as "what we need from the NVB."

## 1.4 Draft Evidence Summary

Write a 1-page evidence brief:
- What we set out to learn
- What we found (3-5 bullets with evidence)
- What we still don't know (honest gaps)
- Our recommendation: do we think we should proceed to Phase 6?
