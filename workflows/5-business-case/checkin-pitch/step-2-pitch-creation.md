# Step 2: Check-in Pitch Deck Creation
<!-- Phase 5, Check-in Pitch Step 2 -->
<!-- Agent: Pitch Master -->

## Objective
Create the check-in pitch deck (7-8 slides, progress-focused) using validated evidence from the evidence compilation. This deck is for the NVB, not investors — focus on evidence gathered, honest gaps, and a clear ask.

---

## 2.1 Load Context

Load:
- `checkin-evidence.md` (from Step 1)
- `pitch-deck.md` template — CHECK-IN PITCH DECK section (7-8 slides)
- `experiment-plan.md` for the "Plan for next 4 weeks" slide

---

## 2.2 Build the Check-in Pitch Deck

Using the CHECK-IN PITCH DECK section of the `pitch-deck.md` template, build all 7-8 slides:

**Slide 1: Title + Venture Hypothesis**
- Venture name and tagline
- The starting hypothesis: customer + problem + solution in one sentence each
- Week # and date

**Slide 2: What We Set Out to Learn**
- The guiding questions from venture-state.yaml
- Methodology: how many interviews, what types, what tools used
- Timeline: what happened in which weeks

**Slide 3: Customer Evidence Gathered**
- Interview stats: # conducted, # types
- Key pain themes from synthesis
- FIP scores (table or visual)
- 2-3 representative customer quotes (direct or labeled as synthetic)

**Slide 4: Pain Validated + ICP Defined**
- Primary pain statement with FIP score
- ICP profile (brief — role, company type, pain intensity)
- Buyer vs. user: same or different?
- Pain journey map highlight (one key insight)

**Slide 5: Solution Hypothesis**
- Wedge definition (one clear sentence)
- Value proposition(s) tested and resonance scores
- Differentiation vs. alternatives (2-3 points)
- Prototype / concept card (if available — screenshot or description)

**Slide 6: What We Need from the NVB**
- Specific questions we have for the NVB
- Concerns or risks we want board input on
- Resources needed to run Phase 6 experiments
- Any directional decisions needed (pivot a hypothesis?)

**Slide 7: Plan for Next 4 Weeks**
- Phase 6 experiment plan (load from experiment-plan.md)
- Key experiments to run (landing page, pilots, business model)
- Pilot customer pipeline status
- Final pitch preparation timeline

**Slide 8 (optional): Market Opportunity**
- TAM/SAM from market-sizing.md
- Why this market is worth the continued investment

## 2.3 Review and Refine

**GUIDED MODE:**
Present draft to user slide by slide. Ask:
- "Does this accurately represent what we found?"
- "Is there any claim here we can't back up with evidence?"
- "Is the ask to the NVB clear?"

**YOLO MODE:** Complete deck and proceed to Step 3.

## 2.4 Save Deck

Save: `{output_folder}/{venture_name}/pitch/checkin-pitch.md`

## Proceed to Step 3 (NVB Review)
