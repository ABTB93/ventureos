# Check-in Pitch Workflow
<!-- Phase 5: Build Initial Business Case — ~Week 8 -->
<!-- Agent: Pitch Master + Venture Evaluator -->
<!-- Step-file architecture: 3 sequential steps -->

## Overview

The check-in pitch is the first NVB decision gate (~Week 8). The venture team presents progress to the New Venture Board (simulated) and receives a Go / No-Go / Revise decision.

**Focus of the check-in gate:**
- Customer pain validation evidence
- Market opportunity assessment
- Solution hypothesis (early wedge concept)
- Plan for next 4 weeks (Phase 6)

**Note:** Full business model, traction data, and financials are NOT required at this gate. The focus is: "Is there enough validated evidence to justify 4 more weeks of incubation?"
