    <agent>venture-ops</agent>
    <instructions>
      Work with the user to frame the venture challenge statement:
      1. Load venture-canvas.md if it exists — use as starting point
      2. Facilitate: "How might we [solve problem] for [customer] so that [outcome]?"
      3. Articulate WHY this venture exists — the reason for incubating this specific idea now
      4. Confirm: entry point (domain exploration or specific idea?)
      5. Set the timeline: incubation start date, Week 8 check-in gate, Week 12 final gate
    </instructions>
  </step>

      Map the team:
      1. Who is on the venture team? Names, roles, backgrounds, % allocation
      2. Identify gaps: What skills are missing? How will gaps be filled (hire, contract, mothership resource)?
      3. Confirm the Sponsor (mothership corporate champion)
      4. Identify the NVB / reporting structure
      5. Clarify: who makes day-to-day decisions vs. who needs to be consulted?
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step n="3" name="cadence-tools">
    <title>Establish Cadence and Tools</title>
    <agent>venture-ops</agent>
    <instructions>
      Set up how the team operates:
      1. Define weekly meeting cadence (stand-up, deep work session, review)
      2. Select tools: project management, comms, docs, research, prototype/build, analytics
      3. Define how decisions get made and escalated
      4. Establish how the team will communicate with the Sponsor and NVB
      5. Set up the output folder structure for venture artifacts
    </instructions>

    <title>Create Team Identity</title>
    <agent>venture-ops</agent>
    <instructions>
      Build the team's identity and culture:
      1. Name/codename for the venture team
      2. 3-5 team values (what we stand for, how we work)
      3. Working norms: what we commit to, what we will always do, what we will never do
      4. How will the team celebrate wins and process learnings?
      5. Energy: what's exciting about this venture for each team member?
    </instructions>

  <step n="5" name="budget-constraints">
    <title>Confirm Budget and Constraints</title>
    <agent>venture-ops</agent>

      2. Legal and IP support — who, contact, availability
      3. Technology/infrastructure support from mothership
      4. Key constraints: regulatory, IP, market segments off-limits
      5. Hard timeline deadlines — what cannot move?
    </instructions>
  </step>

  <step n="6" name="team-charter-output">
    <title>Produce Team Charter</title>
    <agent>venture-ops</agent>

    <template-output file="{output_folder}/{venture_name}/team-charter.md">
