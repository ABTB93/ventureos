      Introduce the Asset Jam:
      "We are going to systematically identify every mothership capability this venture can leverage. Be exhaustive — even assets that seem tangential can be powerful unfair advantages. We'll cover: IP, technology, data, customer relationships, brand, distribution, talent, regulatory access, and financial resources."
      Ask user: Who should be in the room for this exercise? (Venture team + any mothership experts)
