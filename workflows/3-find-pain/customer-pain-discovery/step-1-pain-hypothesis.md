# Step 1: Pain Hypothesis and Interview Preparation
<!-- Phase 3, Step 1 — Weeks 2-3 -->
<!-- Agent: Customer Discovery Specialist -->

## Objective
Formulate or refine pain hypotheses from available research, and prepare interview scripts and outreach strategy.

---

## 1.1 Load and Review Existing Context

Load the following (if they exist from Phase 2):
- `pain-hypothesis.md` — initial pain hypothesis
- `stakeholder-map.md` — persona hypotheses and stakeholder map
- `market-landscape.md` / `competitive-analysis.md` — domain context

If pain-hypothesis.md exists: review and confirm with user. Update if needed.
If starting fresh: facilitate creation using the pain-hypothesis.md template.

---

## 1.2 Refine Pain Hypothesis

Work with the user to sharpen the pain hypothesis:

**Primary Pain Hypothesis:**
- Pain statement: "[Customer] struggles with [pain] when [trigger], causing [consequence]."
- Preliminary FIP estimate (before interviews)
- Key assumptions to test

**Secondary Hypotheses (2-3 alternatives):**
- List alternative pains to probe if the primary doesn't validate

**Prioritization rationale:**
- Why is the primary hypothesis the most promising to test first?

Save updates to `{output_folder}/{venture_name}/pain-hypothesis.md`.

## 1.3 Customer Outreach Planning

Define the interview target list:
1. **Number of interviews needed:** (minimum 10 recommended for validation; 20+ for strong signal)
2. **Interview types to run:** pain-point / expert / both
3. **Target profiles:** specific roles, company types, company sizes, geographies
4. **Where to find them:** LinkedIn, professional networks, mothership customer contacts, communities
5. **Outreach message:** (brief, value-exchange framing — "I want to learn from your experience, not sell anything")
6. **Timeline:** First batch of ___ interviews by Week ___

Create `{output_folder}/{venture_name}/interview-outreach-plan.md` with the target list and approach.

---

## 1.4 Generate Interview Scripts

Based on the pain hypothesis and stakeholder map, generate interview scripts using the `interview-script.md` template:

**Script 1: Pain-Point Interview Script** (for target customers)
- Sections: context setting → pain exploration → FIP probes → closing
- Tailor questions to the specific pain hypothesis

**Script 2: Expert Interview Script** (for domain experts who can validate prevalence)
- Tailor to elicit: how common is this pain? What do most companies do about it?

Save scripts to `{output_folder}/{venture_name}/interview-scripts/`.

---

## 1.5 Checkpoint

**GUIDED MODE:**
Present to user:
- Refined pain hypothesis
- Interview outreach plan
- Interview scripts

Ask: "Are you ready to start interviews? Any changes to the pain hypothesis or scripts before we begin?"

**YOLO MODE:**
Proceed directly to Step 2. If Simulation mode is selected, begin immediately.
