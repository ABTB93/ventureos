# Ecosystem Map
<!-- Product Strategist Agent — Phase 4: Feasibility Assessment -->
<!-- Purpose: Map the value chain, ecosystem players, and where the venture sits -->

## Context
- **Venture:**
- **Solution / Wedge:**
- **Date:**

---

## 1. Value Chain Overview

_(Map the end-to-end flow of value from raw input to the end customer)_

```
[Input/Raw Data/Service] → [Processing Layer] → [Platform/Product] → [Distribution] → [End Customer]
         ↑                                                ↑
   [Suppliers]                                    [Ecosystem Partners]
```

**Our venture's position in the value chain:**
_(Where do we sit? What do we own vs. depend on?)_

---

## 2. Ecosystem Players

### Suppliers / Enablers
_(Who provides the raw inputs our solution depends on)_

| Player | What They Provide | Our Dependency | Alternative Exists? |
|--------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| | | High/Med/Low | |
| | | | |

### Competitors / Substitutes
_(Players who currently address the same customer pain)_

| Player | Approach | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Differentiation |
|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

### Complementors
_(Players who enhance our solution or whom we enhance)_

| Player | How We Complement Each Other | Partnership Potential |
|--------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| | | |

### Distributors / Channels
_(How does value reach the end customer)_

| Channel | Reach | Cost | Fit for Our Wedge |
|---------|-------|------|-------------------|
| | | | |

### Regulators / Standard Bodies
_(Who sets the rules in this ecosystem)_

| Entity | What They Regulate | Impact on Us | Status |
|--------|------------------|-------------|--------|
| | | | |

## 3. Platform / API Ecosystem

_(Technology ecosystem the solution operates within)_

| Platform / API | Role | Integration Required | Availability |
|---------------|------|---------------------|-------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

## 4. Systems Architecture Overview

**Core components of our solution:**

```
[Component A] ←→ [Component B]
      ↓
[Component C] ←→ [External API / Partner System]
```

**Data flows:**
_(What data enters, transforms, and exits the system?)_

**Integration points with existing customer systems:**

---

## 5. Ecosystem Positioning

**Our venture's role in the ecosystem:**
[ ] Platform (others build on us)
[ ] Application (we build on others' platforms)
[ ] Aggregator (we bring together disparate data/services)
[ ] Marketplace (we connect buyers and sellers)
[ ] Point solution (we solve one specific problem)

**Defensibility of our ecosystem position:**
_(What makes our position hard to displace? Network effects, data moat, switching costs, integration depth?)_

**Key ecosystem risks:**
1. _(e.g., platform dependency — if X changes their API terms...)_
2.

## 6. Partnership Strategy

| Partner | Partnership Type | Value to Us | Value to Them | Priority | Next Step |
|---------|----------------|-------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| | | | | High/Med/Low | |
| | | | | | |
