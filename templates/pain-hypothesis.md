# Pain Hypothesis
<!-- Customer Discovery Agent — Phase 3, Step 1 -->
<!-- Purpose: Document initial pain hypotheses before customer interviews -->

## Context
- **Venture:**
- **ICP Hypothesis:**
- **Date:**
- **Based on:** [ ] Domain research  [ ] Prior knowledge  [ ] Mothership insights  [ ] Stakeholder map

## Pain Hypothesis Framework

### Primary Pain Hypothesis

**Pain Statement:**
_(Complete this: "[Customer type] struggles with [pain] when [situation/trigger], which causes [consequence].")_

**Trigger Situation:**
_(What specific situation or event triggers this pain?)_

**Current Workaround:**
_(How does the customer currently deal with this pain today? What tools, processes, or workarounds do they use?)_

**Why the Workaround Fails:**
_(What is insufficient about the current solution?)_

**Preliminary FIP Estimate:**
| Dimension | Estimate (1-5) | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Frequency | | |
| Intensity | | |
| Prevalence | | |
| **FIP Average** | | |

### Secondary Pain Hypotheses (alternatives to explore)

| # | Pain Statement | Trigger | FIP Estimate | Priority |
|---|---------------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | | | | High |
| 2 | | | | Medium |
| 3 | | | | Low |

## Assumptions to Test

| Assumption | How We'll Test It | What We'd See if True | What We'd See if False |

## Key Risks to This Hypothesis
- **Risk 1:** The pain exists but is too infrequent to support a business
- **Risk 2:** The current workaround is good enough that customers won't switch
- **Risk 3:** The pain exists but affects too small a market segment
- **Risk 4:** _(venture-specific)_

## Interview Target for Validation
- **Target number of pain-point interviews:**
- **Target customer profiles to interview:**
- **Target expert interviews:**
- **Geographic focus:**
- **Timeline for first interview batch:**
