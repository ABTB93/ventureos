## 2. Build / Buy / Partner / Invest Analysis

### Option A: Build (Internal Development)
- **What would be built:**
- **Technical requirements:**
- **Estimated build time:**
- **Estimated cost:**
- **Skills / talent required:**
- **Do we have the skills in-house?** [ ] Yes  [ ] Partially  [ ] No
- **Mothership tech assets that could accelerate this:**
- **Feasibility score (1-5):**
- **Key risks:**

### Option B: Buy (Acquire existing technology)
- **Candidate technologies / products:**
- **Acquisition / licensing cost estimate:**
- **Integration complexity:**
- **Feasibility score (1-5):**
- **Key risks:**

### Option C: Partner (Use a partner's technology or service)
- **Candidate partners:**
- **Partnership model (API, white-label, resell):**
- **Revenue share / cost implications:**
- **Dependency risk:**
- **Feasibility score (1-5):**
- **Key risks:**

### Option D: Invest (Take a stake in an existing company)
- **Candidate companies:**
- **Investment thesis:**
- **Timeline to access technology:**
- **Feasibility score (1-5):**
- **Key risks:**

## 4. Technical Feasibility Dimensions

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence / Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Data availability** | Available / Partial / Unavailable | |
| **AI/ML requirements** | None / Achievable / Complex | |
| **Integration complexity** | Low / Medium / High | |
| **Regulatory compliance** | Clear / Needs work / Blocker | |
| **Security requirements** | Standard / Elevated / Complex | |
| **Scalability** | Straightforward / Needs design | |

**Overall technical feasibility:** Low / Medium / High
