# Pain Atomization Matrix
<!-- Customer Discovery Agent — Phase 3, Step 4 -->
<!-- Purpose: Decompose broad pains into atomic testable units and score each on FIP -->
<!-- FIP Framework: See data/scoring/pain-scoring.yaml -->

## Context
- **Venture:**
- **Broad Pain Being Atomized:**
- **Based on:** ___ interviews conducted
- **Date:**

---

## Atomization Instructions
Break the broad pain into its smallest, most specific components — each should be independently addressable. A good atomic pain can be described in one sentence, has a specific trigger, and can be independently scored.

## Atomic Pain Units

### Pain Unit 1: [Short name]

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Pain Statement** | "[Customer] struggles with [specific pain] when [trigger], causing [consequence]." |
| **Trigger** | What specific situation causes this pain? |
| **Consequence** | What happens as a result? (time lost, money wasted, frustration, risk) |
| **Current Fix** | How do they solve this today? |
| **Fix Satisfaction (1-5)** | How satisfied are they with the current fix? |
| **Frequency Score (1-5)** | |
| **Intensity Score (1-5)** | |
| **Prevalence Score (1-5)** | |
| **FIP Average** | (F+I+P)/3 = |
| **FIP Interpretation** | [ ] Strong (≥4.0) [ ] Moderate (3.0-3.99) [ ] Weak (<3.0) |
| **Interview Count** | How many interviews explicitly mentioned this pain? |
| **Representative Quote** | |
