# Wedge Definition
<!-- Product Strategist Agent — Phase 4, Step 1 -->
<!-- Purpose: Define the smallest viable market entry point that can validate the big vision -->

## Context
- **Venture:**
- **Based on:** pain-atomization.md + icp-profile.md
- **Date:**

---

## The Wedge Concept

**Core Principle:** The wedge is the smallest part of the bigger vision that can be quickly brought to market, generates real customer value, and validates the riskiest assumptions about the business.

## Wedge Options Evaluated

### Option A: [Name]
- **What it is:** _(One sentence description of the smallest product/feature)_
- **Who it serves:** _(Specific ICP segment)_
- **Pain it addresses:** _(Specific atomic pain from pain-atomization.md)_
- **How it's unique:** _(What makes this different from current alternatives)_
- **Time to build (estimate):**
- **Riskiest assumption it tests:**
- **Scaling hypothesis:** _(How does this wedge grow into the big vision?)_
- **Score (1-10):** ___

### Option B: [Name]

## Wedge Definition (Selected)

### What Is the Wedge?
_(2-3 sentences describing the smallest product we will bring to market first)_

### Who Is It Exactly For?
- **Primary ICP:** _(role, company type, specific context)_
- **Initial market segment:** _(geography, vertical, size — the most focused possible)_
- **Estimated number of addressable customers in initial segment:**

### What Specific Pain Does It Solve?
- **Atomic pain addressed:** _(from pain-atomization.md)_
- **FIP score of this pain:** F:__ / I:__ / P:__ = __

### What Is the Core Mechanism?
_(How does the wedge actually work? What does the customer do and what happens?)_

### What Is the Primary Value Created?
_(What does the customer get that they didn't have before? Be specific: saves X hours, reduces Y cost, enables Z outcome)_

## Wedge-to-Vision Scaling Hypothesis

**The Wedge (Phase 1 — Months 0-6):**
_(The smallest sellable product)_

**Expand (Phase 2 — Months 6-18):**
_(How the wedge expands — more features, more segments, or both)_

**The Vision (Phase 3 — Months 18+):**
_(The full platform / ecosystem / market position)_

**The critical assumption in the scaling hypothesis:**
_(What must be true for this scaling path to work?)_

## Wedge Build / Prototype Plan

- **Build approach:** [ ] Vibe code (AI-assisted)  [ ] Partner  [ ] Buy  [ ] Invest in existing tech
- **Prototype type:** [ ] Wireframe  [ ] Clickable mockup  [ ] Working prototype  [ ] MVP
- **Estimated time to first prototype:**
- **Estimated time to testable wedge:**
- **Key technical dependencies:**

## Risks to the Wedge

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Customers don't see differentiation | | | |
| Can't build it with available tech | | | |
| Too small a wedge — customers don't pay | | | |
| Wedge doesn't scale to vision | | | |
