---

## Market Definition

_(Be specific: geographic scope, customer segment, product category)_

- **Geography:**
- **Customer Segment:**
- **Problem / Solution Category:**

---

## Top-Down Market Sizing

_(Start with the total market and work down to the serviceable segment)_

### TAM — Total Addressable Market
_(The total global opportunity if you captured 100% of all possible customers)_

- **Market definition:**
- **TAM Source 1:**
- **TAM Source 2:**
- **TAM Source 3:**
- **Reconciled TAM:** $___B

### SAM — Serviceable Addressable Market
_(The segment of the TAM reachable with your current model, geography, and capabilities)_

- **Filtering criteria applied:**
  - Geographic filter: _(e.g., North America only = X% of TAM)_
  - Segment filter: _(e.g., mid-market companies only = Y% of filtered)_
  - Use-case filter: _(e.g., only the specific pain we solve = Z% of filtered)_
- **SAM Calculation:** TAM × ___% × ___% = $___M

### SOM — Serviceable Obtainable Market
_(What you can realistically capture in Years 1-3 given your resources and go-to-market)_

- **Capture rate assumption:** __% of SAM
- **Rationale:** _(comparable companies' market capture rates, sales capacity, etc.)_
- **SOM Year 1:** $___M
- **SOM Year 3:** $___M

## Bottom-Up Market Sizing

_(Build from actual customer numbers — more grounded than top-down)_

### Customer Count Estimation

| Variable | Value | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Total # of target companies globally | | |
| Filter: geography (%) | | |
| Filter: company size fit (%) | | |
| Filter: problem relevance (%) | | |
| **Total addressable customer count** | | |

### Revenue Build-Up

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Addressable customer count | |
| × Conversion rate assumption | % |
| = Potential customers Year 3 | |
| × ACV (Annual Contract Value) | $ |
| = **Bottom-Up Market Size (Year 3)** | $ |

## Triangulation

| Method | Result | Confidence |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Top-Down | $___M | Low/Med/High |
| Bottom-Up | $___M | Low/Med/High |
| **Reconciled Estimate** | $___M | |

**If top-down and bottom-up diverge significantly:**
