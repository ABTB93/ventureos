# Product / Service Roadmap
<!-- Product Strategist Agent — Phase 4 -->
<!-- Purpose: Map the wedge-to-vision product evolution across three phases -->

## Context
- **Venture:**
- **Wedge:**
- **Date:**

---

## Roadmap Philosophy
- **Phase 1 (Wedge):** The smallest thing that validates the riskiest assumption and generates real customer value
- **Phase 2 (Expand):** Deepen and broaden based on validated learnings from the wedge
- **Phase 3 (Vision):** The full platform / ecosystem / market-leading position

---

## Phase 1 — The Wedge
**Timeline:** Months 0–6 (within incubation)
**Goal:** Validate that customers will pay for the core value we create

### Core Features (must-have for wedge)

| Feature | User Story | Priority | Effort | Status |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
| | As a [ICP], I want to [action] so that [benefit] | Must-have | S/M/L | |
| | | Must-have | | |
| | | Must-have | | |

### Wedge Success Metrics
- **Primary metric (the one thing that matters):**
- **Secondary metrics:**
- **What defines "wedge validated":**

### What We Explicitly Are NOT Building in Phase 1
- (scope boundary — important for focus)

---

## Phase 2 — Expand
**Timeline:** Months 6–18 (post-acceleration)
**Goal:** Scale the wedge — deepen for current customers and/or expand to adjacent segments

### Expansion Options to Explore

| Direction | What It Adds | Segment | Hypothesis to Validate |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------------------|
| Deepen | More features for current ICP | Same | |
| Broaden | Same product for new segment | Adjacent | |
| Extend | New product for same ICP | Same | |

### Features Planned for Phase 2
_(Based on evidence — not fully designed yet)_

| Feature Area | Hypothesis | Evidence Needed Before Building |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| | | |

---

## Phase 3 — Vision
**Timeline:** Months 18+ (acceleration stage)
**Goal:** Build the platform/ecosystem/market-leading position described in the vision story

### The Big Vision
_(What does the full product/platform look like at scale?)_

## Dependency Map

| Feature / Phase | Depends On | Risk if Dependency Fails |
|----------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| | | |

---

## Technology Decisions by Phase

| Decision | Phase 1 Choice | Phase 2 Implication | Phase 3 Implication |
|----------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Build vs. buy | | | |
| Core infrastructure | | | |
| AI/ML | | | |
| Data architecture | | | |

---

## Roadmap Risks

| Risk | Phase | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Wedge too narrow to expand | 1→2 | | |
| Technical debt from fast build | 1→2 | | |
| Competition launches before Phase 2 | | | |
