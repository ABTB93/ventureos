# Vision Story — From/To Shift
<!-- Product Strategist / Pitch Master Agent — Phase 4 / Phase 6 -->
<!-- Purpose: Articulate the venture's transformation narrative — the world before and after -->

## Context
- **Venture:**
- **Date:**
- **Audience:** [ ] Internal team  [ ] NVB  [ ] Investors  [ ] Customers

---

## The From/To Framework

The vision story answers: **"What shift in the world does our venture create?"**

It is NOT a product description — it is a transformation narrative. It creates conviction in the opportunity before explaining the solution.

---

## ACT 1: The World Before (FROM — the broken status quo)

### The Undeniable Shift
_(What has changed in the world — technology, regulation, behavior, economics — that creates a new opportunity? This is the "why now" signal.)_

### The Customer in Their Current World
_(Paint a vivid picture of the customer's current reality. What does their day look like? What frustrates them? What workarounds do they live with?)_

### The Systemic Pain
_(What is the broader consequence of this problem — not just for the individual customer, but for their industry, organization, or society?)_

### The Numbers That Make It Real
_(What data proves this is a real, big problem? Interview evidence, market data, cost estimates.)_
- ___ of [customer type] struggle with [pain] every [frequency]
- This costs [industry/segment] $___M per year in [lost time/money/opportunity]
- [X]% of [ICP] rate this pain as [severity] on our interviews

---

## ACT 2: The Shift (THE MOMENT OF CHANGE)

### The Enabling Technology / Insight
_(What new capability, technology, business model innovation, or insight makes a better solution possible NOW that wasn't possible before?)_

### The Wedge — Where Change Starts
_(The specific starting point of the transformation — the smallest beachhead where we introduce the change)_

---

## ACT 3: The World After (TO — the transformed future)

### The Customer in the New World
_(What does the customer's day look like when our solution exists? What becomes possible? What goes away? Be vivid and specific.)_

### The Cascade Effect
_(How does this change ripple outward — from the individual user to their team, organization, and industry?)_

### The Big Vision
_(In 3-5 years, what is the world we're building toward? What is the platform, ecosystem, or market position we're creating from the wedge?)_

---

## The Story in One Paragraph

_(Write the full From/To story as a single compelling narrative — 150-200 words. This is the opening of the pitch.)_

---

## Story Variants by Audience

### For NVB / Check-in Pitch
_(3-5 sentences — focused on validated pain evidence and early solution concept)_

### For Final Investor Pitch
_(Full story — emphasize market size, traction signals, and scaling vision)_

### For Customer
_(Customer-centric — focused on their day-to-day transformation, not the investment thesis)_
