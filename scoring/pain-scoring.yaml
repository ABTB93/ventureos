# Pain Scoring Framework — Frequency / Intensity / Prevalence (FIP)
# Used by Customer Discovery Specialist during Phase 3 (Find Customer Pain)

framework:
  name: "FIP Pain Scoring"
  description: "Score each pain on Frequency, Intensity, and Prevalence to determine if it is strong enough to support a business"
  formula: "(frequency + intensity + prevalence) / 3"

dimensions:
  frequency:
    label: "Frequency"
    question: "How often does the customer experience this pain?"
    scale:
      5: "Daily or multiple times per day"
      4: "Weekly"
      3: "Monthly"
      2: "Quarterly or less"
      1: "Rarely / one-off"

  intensity:
    label: "Intensity"
    question: "How severe is the pain when experienced?"
    scale:
      5: "Extremely painful — stops work, costs significant money, or causes major frustration"
      4: "Very painful — significant workaround required; notable time or money lost"
      3: "Moderately painful — annoying, some workaround exists"
      2: "Mildly painful — minor inconvenience"
      1: "Almost no pain — barely noticed"

  prevalence:
    label: "Prevalence"
    question: "What percentage of the target market experiences this pain?"
    scale:
      5: ">75% of target market has this pain"
      4: "50-75% of target market"
      3: "25-50% of target market"
      2: "10-25% of target market"
      1: "<10% of target market"

thresholds:
  strong:
    min: 4.0
    label: "Strong pain — sufficient to anchor a venture"
  moderate:
    min: 3.0
    max: 3.99
    label: "Moderate pain — warrants further investigation"
  weak:
    max: 2.99
    label: "Weak pain — unlikely to support a business alone"
